The following Salesforce standard and custom objects are used in this project.

= Introduction =

Contacts: Standard Objects
Accounts: Standard Objects


= Details =

Custom Fields:
Lat__c: The latitude of the address.
Lon__c: The longitude of the address

These fields are a must in your Salesforce objects. The latitude and longitude are calculated using a different utility which will calculate the values on timely basis.

I am developing the utility and will post it soon.

The visualforce page uses the above fields to plot the location.
